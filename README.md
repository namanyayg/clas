# Clas - An JS Experiment By Namanyay Goel

Clas was the result of a challenge that I had set on myself&mdash;making a single page, minimal website, that uses Javascript for navigation (Look ma, no libraries!) in one, single hour. The result? [Clas](http://demos.namanyayg.com/clas "Clas").

An unoriginal name, but some simple, clever, nifty Javascript.

I then proceeded to write two tutorials on Clas, one in which you [make the actual website](http://symmetrycode.com/javascript-challenge-fading-single-page-website/) and the other, in which you make it [backward compatible and responsive](http://symmetrycode.com/bonus-making-clas-compatible-responsive/)

And now, when I finally thought to learn Github, I couldn't think of anything better to make open source :D

So here you go! Mess around, play with it! Just remember to show me what you did :)
